Will get a detailed understanding of conditional statements, looping control statements of python.
1.Conditional Statements
In programming when you want to make decisions, you will use if 
statements. The if statement evaluates to Boolean Value.
If you have multiple conditions then we have to use elif statement.
If none of the condition in initial if and elif blocks not executed, then else 
block will get executed.
2.Iterative Statements:
If we want to execute a group of statements multiple times then we should go 
for Iterative statements.
